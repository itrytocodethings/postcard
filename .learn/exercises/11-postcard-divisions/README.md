## `11` Postcard Divisions

Now we have to continue strategyzing about our HTML, we need to continue dividing the postcard in pieces we can easly style and control.

![Postcard Divisions](https://github.com/breatheco-de/exercise-postcard/blob/learnpack/.learn/assets/11-postcard-divisions.gif?raw=true)

Inside your `<div class="postcard">` add three divs that all three of them are immediate childs of it.

```
- .postcard
    - .postcard-header
    - .postcard-body
    - .postcard-footer
```

Please make sure the divs have the specified classes, the first of the 3 dics should have the class `postcard-header`, the second one `postcard-body` and the third one `postcard-footer`, you don't have to include the dot symbols in the HTML document, you will only use the dots in the CSS.
